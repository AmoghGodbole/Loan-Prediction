  <h2>Some data driven observations:</h2>
    <li>People who are male and married tend to have the most income among single men, single women, married men and married women.</li>
    <li>This is observed using the FacetGrid plot in Seaborn.</li>
    <li>Among graduates and people who have not graduated, it is men who have the most income. (Graduated and male)</li>
    <li>From the data, you tend to have more income if you're married and graduated.</li>
    <li>Self employed people have less income than people on a salary.</li>
    <li>If you're graduated and on a salary, the probability that your income is high are the most when considering the criteria of self employment and graduation</li>
    <li>People who have live in urban areas and have credit history have the best income, when considering property and credit history as the criteria.</li>
    <li>People who are married and have credit history have the best applicant income.</li>
  <li>More such observations can be derived by using histograms, distplots and facetgrid plots. </li>
  <li>We were therefore, successful in making good data driven observations, classifying the data and make good predictions using our scikit-learn <bold>LogisticRegressor</bold> model.</li>
